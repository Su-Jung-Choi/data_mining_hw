    "By trying a range of values, we can choose appropriate value k that has high accuracy rate.\n",
    "By using get_sample function below, I tried different k values to random sample set by shuffling the training data. So I picked k=4 as it gives good enough accuracy rate. With the actual training dataset, I got accuracy rate of 86% when k=4. Additionally, when I used the whole data set to find the best value for K, K = 7 gave me an accuracy of 90%. Therefore, for the best result, we would use K = 7."
